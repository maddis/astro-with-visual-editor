## Nichola & Danny are joining the We Love Pets family with their new Chelmsford branch! As usual, we want to welcome them into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Yes! We have been proud parents of, Tinks, our cat who we rescued from a neighbour. Tinks is very cuddly and loves to smile!

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Nichola was a child minder and Danny is an IT Technician. Their dream was to work with animals.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

We can’t wait to get out and about! We love to be outside and are both very excited to be working with animals and can’t wait to meet everyone’s pets.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

Initially Nichola looked into dog walking and looked into setting up on her own but the more she thought about it she realised that there was a lot to consider and started to research franchises. After discovering the We Love Pets website and a chat with Ryan, We Love Pets Managing Director she realised this was the business for them. We love the brand, the systems that are in place and the great family feel.

## Do you have any hobbies?

Our hobbies include exploring new places, spending time at the beach and the local wildlife trust. We are very family orientated and absolutely love spending time with our family and friends.
