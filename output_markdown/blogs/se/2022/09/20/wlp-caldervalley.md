## James & Fiona are joining the We Love Pets family with their new Calder Valley branch! As usual, we want to welcome them into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Yes! We live on a farm and have lots of pets. We have been proud foster parents with Silver Fox dog rescue for 2 years and have welcomed lots of foster dogs during that time. We now have 2 chihuahuas Echo and Saffron who are mother and daughter. We have 3 rescue cats – Boggy, Paddy and Gracie and 6 horses including; Gwendolyn the Shire Horse, 3 pure bred Arabs – Jak, Dominicus & Becks that our daughter Becky competes with. Then there’s Sid our Gypsy Vanner cob and Cherry a part bred Arab. In addition on the farm we have 4 Chinese geese and several silkies and hens.

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Fiona: I was a mobile hairdresser and James is a quantity surveyor. Our daughter Becky will also be joining us in the business and has worked at an equine veterinary practise for the past 6 years.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

We are both very excited to be working with animals and can’t wait to meet everyone’s pets and get to know their owners. We look forward to making a difference knowing that families can go away on holiday with peace of mind that their pets will be loved and well cared for while they are away.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

It was during a conversation with a best friend that mentioned his sister-in-law had a We Love Pets franchise and highly recommended the business. After a look on the We Love Pets website and a chat with Ryan, We Love Pets Managing Director, we realised that there was a gap in our area. We love the brand, the systems that are in place and the great business support.

## Do you have any hobbies?

Our hobbies include horse riding, cooking, reading and fixing fences – there is always plenty of farm maintenance to be taking care of!
