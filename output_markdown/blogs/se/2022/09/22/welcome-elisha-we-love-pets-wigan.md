## **Elisha is taking over the We Love Pets Wigan branch! As usual, we want to welcome them into the network with a We Love Pets interview!**

## **Do you have any pets? What are their names?**

Yes, I have 2 dogs Teddy who’s 4 and Charlie who’s 12.  I also have Tonto the tortoise and used to have a rat, gerbil, hamster, horse and bearded dragon.

## **What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?**

During my work placement at college, I worked at a local dog day care.  I knew then that I always wanted to work with animals. 2 years ago, I joined We Love Pets as a dog walker and have loved every minute.  When the opportunity came up for me to take over the branch, I knew it was meant to be!

## **What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?**

I love We Love Pets!  I love their values, their customer promise, that welfare is number one and I really can’t wait to be my own boss.

## **How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?**

When the local dog day care closed, I started to look for part time work and it was then that I saw the position advertised for a We Love Pets dog walker and have never looked back.

## **Do you have any hobbies?**

I love spending time in nature and visiting the lake district as often as I can.  I also do agility competing with my dogs, Charlie and Teddy.
