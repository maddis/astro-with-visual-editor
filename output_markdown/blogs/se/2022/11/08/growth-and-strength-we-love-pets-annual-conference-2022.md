On the 15th October 2022, We Love Pets held its third Annual Conference, where all their franchisee network were able to meet up for the day, share stories, success, challenges and find out all the latest news and innovation from Head Office.

This year’s theme focused on the strength and growth of the network. Kicking off with an inspirational video illustrating how much the franchisees had grown and strengthened in just the past year, since their previous Annual Conference. Figures including; over 4,000 new pets put into We Love Pets care, 57,408 miles covered by dog walkers, 500 new staff recruited, a whopping 429 new 5\* Google reviews. There was even a section which included how the We Love Pets head office team had supported and grown the network. With 23 new franchisees onboarded, 42 drop in sessions were held. We Love Pets also hired a Franchise Support Manager, Wendy, In July 2022. Who in just three months had already had 46 one-to-one chats with the network – setting personal goals towards success and business growth.

At We Love Pets, 74% of the franchisees are women, “it’s inspiring every day watching women take control of their working lives by stepping into business”- says Jo White, Founder.

We heard from a selection of these empowering women and it was truly insightful to hear their stories. One franchisee, Laura from Haywards Heath, said “I wanted to prove I was so much more than just a mum” and explained her struggles of wanting to own her own business alongside raising her two young children. “Owning my own business means I am able to be there for the school drop off and pick up. I don’t have to choose between work or family. I don’t have to miss out on spending time with my children due to being stuck in a 9-5 job. I don’t have to worry about finding alternative childcare, because I can be there and run my business. It’s the best of both worlds” – says Laura

The day was filled with passion, laughter and support from everyone. There were brilliant announcements and news from Head Office and the franchise has another action packed year ahead.
