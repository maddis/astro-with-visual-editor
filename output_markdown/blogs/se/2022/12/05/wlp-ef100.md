We Love Pets have landed their spot in the HSBC Elite Franchise Top 100 – for their sixth year running!

#### We Love Pets are proud to have ranked 63 in the top 100 for 2023!

We Love Pets is the UK’s largest pet care franchise, on a mission to “consistently raise the bar of animal welfare through the pet care industry”. We contribute to every community we have a branch by providing quality, affordable, and regulated pet care services. We also contribute to the education of pet care and welfare across the country with our learning management system, [Novabright](https://novabright.io/) and our charity, [Boop](https://www.boop.org.uk/)!

“We’re thrilled to be in the top 100 again for 2023! We can’t thank everyone who is involved with We Love Pets enough, from our head office team, fantastic network of franchisees and their staff, all the way to our customers and their gorgeous pets across the UK, we couldn’t do it without you all. Thank you!” – Ryan and Jo White (Managing Director and Founder of We Love Pets).

The EF100 Awards were established in 2017 in association with HSBC. The Awards are all about paying tribute to the greatest franchises the UK has to offer, and ranks them recognising their statistics such as the size of the company and the rate of its growth are valued alongside evaluative assets such as future ambitions and what contributions have been made to franchisees and the communities they serve. Entries are officiated by an independent panel of industry professionals to ensure testing is objective and the results are valid. This year, the judging panel welcomed industry heavyweights Pip Wilkins and Emily Price, the CEO and Chief Operating Officer of the British Franchise Association.

Anita Roberts also joined the judging panel again this year, Anita is the Franchise Director at HSBC UK, the league’s major sponsor. “It is amazing recognition for the franchisors,” says Anita. “Those ranked in the top 100 should display their award with pride, illustrating their excellence as a brand to those inside and outside of the franchise industry.”
