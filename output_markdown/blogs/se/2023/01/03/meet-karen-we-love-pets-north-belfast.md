## Karen is joining the We Love Pets family with her new franchise in Belfast! As usual, we want to welcome him into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

In the past I have had lots of different dogs including a German Shepard and Collies.

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

I started my career with animals working as an assistant trainer and jockey in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Since then, I have owned a pet sitting business in South Africa for 8 years and qualified as a dog groomer 35 years ago.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

I can’t wait to work with animals every day, giving love and enrichment to the pets and getting to know their owners. I am a passionate animal lover and especially enjoy walking in the countryside.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

I was looking for an established pet care business and google directed me to We Love Pets. I did plenty of research and chose We Love Pets as it was obvious that they were established, credible and had shown growth through their network of franchises.

## Do you have any hobbies?

I enjoy keeping fit and used to complete in triathlons. I love to travel, read and to wind down and relax with a good Netflix series.
