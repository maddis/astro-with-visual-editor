#### Boxing legend, Gary Logan and his finance Lisa have launched We Love Pets Crystal Palace! Gary and Lisa both have a huge passion for pets and were a great inspiration with their positive outlook on life. Gary will even be running a mindset workshop at our next Annual Conference (and maybe even some team boxing sessions for head office!) Find out more about this fantastic and passionate duo from their interview below!

## Why did you choose a franchise over setting up your own business?

Lisa: The support offered from head office, and all the other franchisees was a massive appeal. It really gave off that family feel and we wanted to join that.

Gary: We Love Pets says what it is on the tin. And so far you’ve delivered! Training has been immense and full of laughs and we can’t wait to start.

## Did you look at any other franchises and why did you choose WLP?

Lisa: Yes, we did look into a few franchises. However, after speaking to Ryan and really having that eye opener that We Love Pets offered so much more than a pet care service with all their welfare policies and beliefs, learning management system and charity, in addition the strength of the brand – it really in our eyes was the best of the business. We Love Pets has a service that covers everything and everyone.

Gary: The welfare was really important and is something we both are strongly passionate for. Being able to make that difference and give regulated loving care to pets, as well as the resources of education to offer is so important to us both.

## What was your day to day like in your previous role, and why did you decide to switch paths?

Lisa: I have spent the last 30+ years in the hair and beauty industry. I love meeting and talking to people and running my own pet care business still allows for this and goes inline with my true passion. Over the 30 years my top topic of conversation with clients would always be about their pets. We Love Pets allows us to follow our dream and it’s going to be so fulfilling helping others with their pets. Plus who wouldn’t want to look after animals for a living?

Gary: I have always been a boxer. Total of 42 champions fights, last fight was in 2003. Since 2003, I have been a Personal Trainer and Boxing Coach. I have been involved in Professional Boxing Coaching, alongside Adam Booth who trained David Hayes, Andy Lee and George Grove – People who know boxing, know these guys. I have been friends with Adam Booth since I was 14 years old, so we are in a 40 year friendship and we have had some amazing professional experiences together. Adam himself is interested in We Love Pets, and everything you guys do.

## How long had you been thinking about changing your career and why?

We have been looking into pet care franchises for a while and have been speaking with Ryan for well over six months before taking the plunge. Ryan helped us realise what a franchise like We Love Pets really offers, it’s not just gathering lots of pets and taking them out. There’s so much more behind the scenes for the welfare of the pets to think about. The support that was offered even right from the start from Ryan is really what gave us the confidence to dive in.

## Do you have any pets of your own?

Lisa: We don’t currently have pets of our own, but we are that couple you see walking around parks and chatting to every dog owner we can about their dog. We are both obsessed with dogs, especially the larger breeds such as, Newfoundlands and St. Bernards. Gary is a true cat lover. I grew up with a variety of pets from dogs, rabbits and even donkeys, and have owned two large breed dogs of my own in adult life. Although, the one pet I always wanted growing up and my parents wouldn’t allow was guinea pigs! I absolutely love guinea pigs and can’t wait for that call for guinea pig care/sitting to come in!

Gary: We both want a dog of our own and this is something we can hopefully introduce in the short term. In the meantime, being able to help others take care of their pets is reward enough.

## What do you love most about your area?

Crystal Palace park is a beautiful and massive park, fantastic for dog walking. However, we have lots of little parks dotted around ready for exploring.

## What have you done in the past that you think will help you in your new venture?

Lisa has been working with people for over 30 years and is a great communicator, easy to talk to and fun to be around. Lisa will grow fantastic relationships with her customers and help pet owners choose the right care tailored to their pets needs.

Gary: Boxing is my life and got me to where I am today. “Life is boxing, and boxing is life”. It’s all about positive mindsets and taking 8 seconds to breathe and compose, instead of reacting with ego. I will be helping the We Love Pets head office team by running a mindset workshop at the end Annual Conference. Gary is also great with people and always has a calm and positive presence.

## What interesting fact do you have?

In Gary’s boxing career he has had 69 fight wins, 85 contests fought and 2 championship medals! Gary still does media work with Sky Sports and has said he will always keep a foot in the door with the Boxing World.

## Which are your favourite animals?

We are animal mad. There is no bias, we can’t wait to care for all animals. We both love large breed dogs and Gary does have a soft spot for cats, saying “I love all the unique personality and characters of cats”. When Gary sees a cat outside on the street or up on a fence, he will have to stop for a quick hello and neck scratch.

## What do you think will be the best part of your job as a We Love Pets franchisee owner and what are you most looking forward to?

Making a change. Helping pet owners with care and education. After the pandemic, rescues have seen a huge rise in dogs being given up. We can’t visit rescue centres as we would want to come home with them all.. But running a We Love Pets business gives us a chance to help pet owners and the pets in a different way.

Gary: To go into business with a partner you’re really close with, to do something you’re both passionate about – means a lot. It’s hard to put that into words. It’s something very close to both our hearts and we just can’t wait to get started.

Gary and Lisa both have the same huge love and passion for animals and hold the same values – shared with the We Love Pets model. They will make a perfect duo and provide the best loving care to the pets of Crystal Palace.
