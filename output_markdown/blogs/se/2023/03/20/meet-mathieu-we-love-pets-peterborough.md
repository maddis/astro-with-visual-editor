We Love Pets is excited to announce the arrival of our newest franchisee, Mathieu! With his passion for animals and extensive business background, we believe Mathieu is the perfect addition to our team.

Before joining We Love Pets, Mathieu worked in the customer services industry for over a decade. However, he had always dreamed of owning his own business, and his love for animals made We Love Pets an obvious choice.

Mathieu has always been a pet lover. He understands the bond between humans and their furry friends, and he believes that pets are an important part of any family.

After researching several pet-related business opportunities, Mathieu chose to become a We Love Pets franchisee because he was impressed with the company’s commitment to pet welfare and its focus on providing high-quality pet care services.

As a We Love Pets franchisee, Mathieu will be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of his own pet care business. He will manage a team of [**pet care professionals**](https://welovepets.care/branch/peterborough) who provide a range of services, including dog walking, pet sitting, and pet boarding.

Mathieu is excited to build relationships with his clients and their pets, and he looks forward to helping his community by providing reliable, compassionate pet care services.

We Love Pets is thrilled to welcome Mathieu as our newest franchisee. With his passion for animals and business acumen, we are confident that Mathieu will thrive in his new role.
