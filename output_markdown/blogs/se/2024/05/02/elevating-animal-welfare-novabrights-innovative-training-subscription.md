## **The Industry’s New Standard: Novabright & We Love Pets Lead the Way**

We Love Pets, the UK’s top-tier full-service pet care franchise, is at the forefront of industry innovation with the launch of Novabright’s online training subscription service, set to enrich animal welfare standards in home boarding across the nation.

## **Mandatory Excellence: Raising the Bar for Pet Home Boarding Training**

Compliance with the UK’s stringent regulations requires home boarding professionals to undergo comprehensive training, underscoring the need for skill enhancement tailored to improve animal welfare and safety. We Love Pets, commanding a vast network of 116 franchises, is spearheading change with a pioneering animal welfare training platform via Novabright Training Ltd.

Ryan White, the co-founder of We Love Pets and Novabright, shares, “We created Novabright in 2022 with a vision: to furnish our franchisees and their teams with unparalleled training. Our efforts culminated in the Level 3 Animal Licensing Inspector Award in 2023, setting a new benchmark for care and compliance.”

At Novabright’s helm is Adam Harper, whose expertise in animal welfare and education underpins the company’s success. His credentials are extensive and diverse, signifying his commitment to animal care education and conservation.

## **A Learning Revolution: Novabright’s Subscription Model**

With Harper’s leadership, Novabright’s offering of Ofqual-registered courses has attracted a community of over 1,700 learners. The newly introduced subscription model is a strategic innovation, simplifying the continuous education requirement with a single monthly payment plan. Ryan and Jo White’s decision to extend Novabright’s subscription model to all UK pet care franchises is a bold gesture that underscores a shared mission for animal welfare excellence across the industry
