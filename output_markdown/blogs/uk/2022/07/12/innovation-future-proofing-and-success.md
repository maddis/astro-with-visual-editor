## Since We Love Pets was established in 2007, we have achieved our aim of becoming the largest pet care franchise in the UK.

With over 170 branches offering award winning dog walking, dog sitting, holiday boarding and pet sitting to thousands of pet loving customers.

The We Love Pets model of pet care puts pets first and gives them the loving, personal and professional level of care they deserve. Instead of having strangers take care of pets, or burdening friends and relatives, friendly and fully trained We Love Pets local teams are there to provide a flexible service that works around customer’s schedule and situation.

Pets can stay in their home and receive visits from us and those that like to get out there and socialise can play with friends, we know are suitable on our dog walks. Our pet carers love and understand animals above all else and with our rigorous standards and background checks in place, you’ll always feel completely at ease that your pet is in the best possible hands.

We pride ourselves on offering welfare first services (we don’t do pack walking) and all staff are trained to a high level before they even meet a pet! We offer ongoing CPD and training for all WLP people so they can progress on their career journey. We Love Pet’s franchisees are people who wanted to leave their stressful, unfulfilling jobs behind and run their own successful business in something they’re passionate about.

With our unrivalled support package our franchisees are enjoying financial and business success at record levels. Innovation has been our theme for 2022. We have received a European innovation grant for our future proof website, customer portal, AI functions and new training platform, [Novabright](https://novabright.io/), which is a first of its kind.

To accelerate sustainable growth, we are developing app to provide one customer interface (including customer portal, CRM, booking system and payment gateway). It will incorporate AI and enable franchisees to have real time relationships with customers, using live chats to avoid third party tools such as WhatsApp. It will enable us to expand into Europe and internationally.

## Our motto is “the best business owners NEVER stop learning”.

We have built our own Learning Management System (LMS) called [Novabright](https://novabright.io/) with innovative partnerships with colleges to train and upskill franchisees and staff in pet care, so we can continuously deliver value to our customers. Not only are our [Novabright](https://novabright.io/) courses available to all WLP franchisees and staff, but [Novabright](https://novabright.io/) is also available to the public, allowing anyone and everyone to complete courses on pet care and animal welfare from anywhere!

We are the only pet care franchise with our own LMS and training courses, designed and led by one of the UK’s top animal care lecturers, Adam Harper, plus a team of vets, vet nurses and animal care lecturers. All franchisees and their team have unlimited access to our suite of online courses – from Ofqual qualifications in boarding to help to obtain higher standards, to animal nutrition and dog behaviour, all franchisees and staff can progress and upskill into pet care experts throughout their journey with We Love Pets.

We have won multiple awards including Pet Care Provider of the Year, the BFA Emerging Franchisor of the Year, Best Franchise Award for two years running, Elite Franchise Top 100 for five years running, and we’ve featured on the BBC, Channel 4 and in the Telegraph.

## It doesn’t stop there!

We’ve been granted charitable status for the our new Boop Charity (coming very soon) with the aim of providing all young people (particularly those from vulnerable backgrounds) the opportunity to access pet care and animal welfare courses and workshops, with the aim of enhancing the lives of young people and pets through education.

The adversity we have overcome during the pandemic has made the network stronger together and has reinforced our family values ethos. We are looking forward to the remainder of 2022 for sustainable growth and leading the way in animal welfare in the pet care industry.
