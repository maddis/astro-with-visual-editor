## Kirsty & Matt are joining the We Love Pets family with their new Crawley branch! As usual, we want to welcome them into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Sadly, our own dog recently passed away, however, we have our family dog, Bailey, and often have our neighbour’s dog, Reggie over for visits. We look forward to getting another dog in the future.

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Kirsty was an office administrator and Matt is a financial advisor. Kirsty dreamt of a job that she would wake up every day and be excited to do – and now she has found it!

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

We love the thought of doing something together that we enjoy and can personally invest in. We are excited to have the freedom to work for ourselves.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

Initially, Kirsty investigated dog walking and looked into setting up on her own but the more she thought about it she realised that there was a lot to consider. It was at her cousin’s party that a family friend mentioned they knew someone who owned a We Love Pets franchise. After reading the We Love Pets website she realised this was the business for them. We love the values that We Love Pets stands for, the fact that they train their franchisees so well and their number one priority is the welfare of the animals.

## Do you have any hobbies?

We both love to keep active and fit. Matt loves to go to the gym and Kirsty teaches pole fitness.
