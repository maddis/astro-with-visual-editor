We Love Pets scored an amazing 95% from their franchise network from Workbuzz’s Franchise Satisfaction Benchmark survey.

#### The highest score out of 300 brands!

WorkBuzz is a leading, independent franchise consultancy that helps reputable franchisors to improve their performance and growth. One of the ways they do this is by inviting franchisees to participate in an anonymous, online survey, which asks them questions about their franchise ownership experience, to identify and understand how the franchise network is performing from its franchisees’ perspective.

In September 2022, We Love Pets franchisees took part in the survey. We Love Pets scored an impressive total satisfaction benchmark score of 95% and scored well above WorkBuzz’s industry averages for the six key themes measured. *Please see table below*

*\*The report is published by WorkBuzz. It is not intended to be an endorsement or recommendation by WorkBuzz. It is strongly recommended that any prospective franchisee completes thorough due diligence and receives professional advice before investing in any franchise.*

“*The WorkBuzz survey is a great way to understand how well we’re performing. This pushes us towards our plan to develop a successful future for the network. Although we’re ecstatic to receive 95% we will still be looking into the 5% and all feedback received to improve our model even further. As the survey is conducted by a third party, and is entirely anonymous, we can be confident we’re getting honest feedback from our network. The overall happiness of our franchisees speaks for itself from our results.*” – Managing Director, Ryan White.

“*The franchisor’s leadership has a clear vision for the future*”. – said 72% of the We Love Pets franchise network.

“*The long-term prospects for my franchise business are very good*” said 70% of the We Love Pets franchise network.

“*I would recommend this franchise to a prospective franchisee*” and “*I am proud to be a franchisee with this company*” was said by 72% of the We Love Pets franchise network.
