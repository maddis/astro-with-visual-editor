## **Honor is joining the We Love Pets family with her new franchise in Ashford! As usual, we want to welcome her into the network with a We Love Pets interview!**

## **Do you have any pets? What are their names?**

Yes! I absolutely adore my pets, I have two cats; Ciri and Mario, two Doberman dogs; Pacho and Nova, a hamster called Jaxs and many pond fish.

## **What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?**

I have spent many years in various industries such as food service and construction and most recently in an international poultry business as a commercial manager.

## **What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?**

I’m really excited to be escaping the busy corporate life and being in control of my own destiny. I can’t wait to have a successful business that I can grow around my family, that’s rewarding and allows me to have a positive experience everyday working with animals. Walking dogs and being active is the highlight of my day!

## **How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?**

I was looking for an established pet care business and turned to google for help. Google immediately directed me to We Love Pets.

I hadn’t previously considered buying a franchise, however, after doing my research and watching We Love Pets videos it felt like the right choice. We Love Pets were transparent in their financial projections making it a great return on investment, they also had great reviews from existing franchisees.

## **Do you have any hobbies?**

I love watching various sports including tennis, volleyball, and football. I love to travel, with and without my dogs. I keep fit with walking and Pilates and I’m an avid Playstation gamer.
