## **Connie is joining the We Love Pets family with her new franchise in Battle! As usual, we want to welcome her into the network with a We Love Pets interview!**

## **Do you have any pets? What are their names?**

Yes! I have a two gorgeous red fox Labradors called Otis and Ollie, and several fish.

## **What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?**

Before joining We Love Pets I worked as a café manager and prior to that I worked with horses and was a film student.

## **What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?**

I’m very excited about the new challenge and journey ahead of me, I can’t wait to be my own boss, work from home and be in charge of my destiny.

## **How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?**

I found We Love Pets online, I knew the owner of another branch and was a We Love Pets customer.  I love the customer promise of no pack walking and I can’t wait to give my customers the same exceptional service that I received when I was a We Love Pets customer.

## **Do you have any hobbies?**

I love reading and watching Science fiction movies, the best part of my day is walking the dogs.
