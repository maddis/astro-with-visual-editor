## **Holly is joining the We Love Pets family with her new franchise in Canterbury! As usual, we want to welcome her into the network with a We Love Pets interview!**

## **Do you have any pets? What are their names?**

For the first time in my life I don’t. In the past I’ve had dogs, cats, chickens, goats and many hamsters. However, my sisters dog, Archie – the Cockapoo, often comes to stay with us.

## **What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?**

Before joining We Love Pets I worked for a charity called Porchlight, supporting vulnerable people with their mental health and housing.

## **What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?**

I can’t wait to have a successful business that I can grow around my family, that’s rewarding and allows me to have a positive experience everyday working with animals. I can’t wait to get to meet all the animals and their owners in our community.

## **How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?**

My partner initially researched franchises and came across We Love Pets. As soon as we had a call with Ryan the Managing Director, we knew this was the business for us.  Ryan is exceptionally passionate, friendly, honest and has a dedicated team offering top class franchise support.

## **Do you have any hobbies?**

I have two young children aged 16 months and 6 years, so most of my spare time is always spent with my family. We love visiting animal parks and taking my daughter to horse riding lessons. My 16-month daughter’s first word was DOG and the 1st time she laughed was when she heard Archie bark so the love for animals and dogs runs in the family.

During my chill out time I love to read, go to see live music and eat nice food!
