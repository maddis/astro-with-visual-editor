When you hear a successful brand coming together with other likeminded brands to make an impact that is when you know you’re successful in business and a pioneer for creating the pillars of change.

We Love Pets are proud to be a founding member of the Pet Care Franchise Association and joined up with Barking Mad, PetPals and Petstay to create a culture of change within the pet care industry.

Whilst recognising strong growth and demand across our 100 franchisees due to the boom across the whole pet care industry, we wanted to support our strong values of ‘pet welfare first’.

The PCFA has a membership criterion that focuses on animal welfare and franchising ethics and together we work to influence government policy and come together as a collective to raise the bar in pet care.

We Love Pets brings a strong cohort of combined experience including vets, dog trainers, pet behaviourists and legal experts. Our technical expertise and accolades in innovation means we can continue to develop and roll out courses to our customers and other PCFA members from our sister company Novabright to help educate customers and support fellow members.

By having a great relationship with our fellow pet care business founders, we are able to endorse and help promote the PCFA and instil a culture and set of beliefs every pet carer should have whilst looking after customers pets.

We give thanks to all our fellow founders and look forward to sharing our success stories in the future as we embark on this exciting venture as one organisation!
