## Jacqui is joining the We Love Pets family with her new franchise in [Wantage](https://welovepets.care/branch/wantage). As usual, we want to welcome her into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Yes! I have two gorgeous dogs, Otis who is a mixed breed, and Olive a chocolate lab.

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Before joining We Love Pets, I lived in France for 9 years. My husband and I renovated a barn and built our home there. We opened a gardening business and I worked as an Estate Agent.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

I can’t wait to work with animals! I’ve grown up with animals and look forward to combining my passion for animals with my strong business acumen to grow a successful business that will allow me a flexible schedule around my family and two small children.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

I initially applied for a dog walker position with We Love Pets and it was during the interview that it was suggested I would be far better suited as a Franchisee. I was very impressed by the business model, the franchise support offered and the great team. I can’t wait to be part of the We Love Pets family.

## Do you have any hobbies?

I love dog walks, running, yoga and keeping active. I love to get stuck in to creative design and build projects, ranging from shoes racks to houses to get my fix!

Friends, Family and Food are my passion.
