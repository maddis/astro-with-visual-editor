## Kate is joining her sister, [Holly](https://welovepets.care/business-news/meet-holly-we-love-pets-canterbury/), to work together with their new franchise in [Canterbury](https://welovepets.care/branch/canterbury/)! As usual, we want to welcome her into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Yes! I have an adorable cockapoo called Archie. As a child I had many pets including chickens, hamsters, rabbits and a bearded dragon.

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Before joining We Love Pets, I worked for 20 years as a primary school teacher and more recently as a manager of a co-working hub.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

I can‚Äôt wait to work with my sister! I‚Äôm excited that there is a great support network of franchisees. This will give me the opportunity to do something different and work with animals.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

I saw how happy and excited my sister, Holly, was after she completed her initial We Love Pets training and decided to take the plunge and join her as a business partner.

## Do you have any hobbies?

I play the guitar and piano. I go running and I‚Äôm aiming to complete a race soon.

And I totally love penguins!üêß
