## Bryan is joining the We Love Pets family with his new franchise in [Livingston](https://welovepets.care/branch/livingston/). As usual, we want to welcome him into the network with a We Love Pets interview!

## Do you have any pets? What are their names?

Yes! I have two dogs Max and Leela, both rottweilers and 2 cats Axel and Safka

## What have you done previously before deciding to start your journey with WLP?

Before joining We Love Pets I worked as a manager in Lidl for six years and have had substantial retail sales experience.

## What are you most excited about with owning a WLP branch?

I can’t wait to work with animals. I’m very excited about the challenge to work for myself and be my own boss. I’m confident that with the support from We Love Pets head office and fellow franchisees, I will have a thriving business and a great team of my own.

## How did you discover WLP? Why did you choose WLP?

I was researching setting up my own dog walking business and came across We Love Pets. Suddenly, my 2 year plan became a 2 month plan and here I am ready to launch my own franchise! I was very impressed right form the start and had no hesitation that this was right for me.

## Do you have any hobbies?

I love spending time with my dogs and going to the occasional music festival.
