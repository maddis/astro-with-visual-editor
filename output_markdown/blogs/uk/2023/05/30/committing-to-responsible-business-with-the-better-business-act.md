We are thrilled to announce a significant milestone in our journey at We Love Pets – our commitment to the Better Business Act, an innovative movement that is reshaping the way businesses approach their responsibilities towards their communities, employees, and the environment.

The Better Business Act is a ground-breaking campaign that advocates for an inclusive business approach, wherein every organization in the UK works towards not only financial profit, but also the welfare of society and our planet. By joining this initiative, We Love Pets has demonstrated our dedication to a balanced, sustainable, and ethical business model.

At We Love Pets, we firmly believe that pets are more than companions – they’re family. This belief fuels our commitment to providing excellent care and services. Now, with the Better Business Act, our responsibility extends further, enveloping the pet owners, our employees, communities, and the environment in our sphere of care.

Joining the Better Business Act aligns with our ethos perfectly. We aim to balance our commitment to profitability with the betterment of society. It is a purposeful step towards integrating sustainable practices into our business model, ensuring that we positively impact not only the lives of pets and their owners but also the communities we serve and our shared environment.

We are excited to embark on this new journey, where we prioritise purpose alongside profit. As we forge ahead, we pledge to make every decision, every initiative, and every service reflective of this commitment.

We want to express our gratitude to all our customers and employees who have supported us in this journey. Your belief in our mission continues to drive us forward. We promise to strive towards creating a better world for our pets and our planet.

Keep an eye on our website and social media channels for updates on our initiatives and the positive changes we hope to bring. We are eager to share this journey with you, and we look forward to your continued support.

We Love Pets – for a better world for our pets and our planet.
