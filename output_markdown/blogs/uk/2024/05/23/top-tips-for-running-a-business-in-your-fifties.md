## **Take the risk out of starting a business in your fifties by investing in a franchise**

Franchising is often considered a better option than starting a business from scratch because it provides a pre-established brand and business model. This typically means immediate brand recognition, a proven track record, and an existing customer base, which can significantly reduce the risk and uncertainty associated with new ventures. Franchises also usually come with full training and ongoing support, streamlining operations, and helping to avoid common start-up mistakes. For many, these benefits make franchising a safer investment and a quicker path to profitability.

## **Top tips for picking the right franchise:**

Here are some top tips for those over 50 considering franchising in the UK:

1. Due Diligence: Investigate the franchisor’s history and stability. Check their financial performance, reputation, and support structures.

2. Legal Advice: Consult with a solicitor who specialises in franchise law to understand your rights and obligations.

3. Training and Support: Confirm the training and ongoing support you will receive, as this is critical for transitioning to a new business model.

4. Location and Territory: Research the allocated territory to ensure it has the potential customer base you need for success.

5. Financial Planning: Have a clear financial plan, including how you will fund the purchase and how it fits into your retirement planning.

6. Health and Work-Life Balance: Consider the physical demands of the franchise and ensure it fits with your desired lifestyle.

7. Exit Strategy: Plan, including how and when you might sell the franchise.

Remember, it’s about finding the right fit for your skills, goals, and the lifestyle you want in your later career journey.
