As the UK’s largest full-service pet care franchise with over 180 branches, we’ve encountered numerous questions about our business. Here, we address the two most frequently asked ones. Should you have any further queries, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

## **How Do I Know It Will Work for Me?**

We believe our success stories speak volumes. You can explore how well our franchisees are doing by reading their case studies and testimonials in our magazine, on our website, and on our YouTube channel. For a more personal touch, feel free to call and chat with any of our franchisees. We pride ourselves on our transparency and encourage you to seek honest feedback to help you make an informed decision.

## **Will I Earn Enough to Pay My Bills and Live My Life?**

This is understandably one of the most common questions we receive. Making the switch from your current job to one driven by your passion can be intimidating, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. We firmly believe that a career in pet care allows individuals to follow their love for animals while enjoying the benefits of being their own boss and achieving financial stability.

The great news is that we’re with you every step of the way, providing support whenever you need it. On average, most franchise owners recoup their initial investment within seven months.

It’s crucial to ensure you have enough cash flow to sustain yourself until your business starts generating income. We discuss this in detail when reviewing your business plan to ensure you’re well prepared for this exciting journey.
