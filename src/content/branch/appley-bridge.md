- description: Fairy Glen, just outside Appley Bridge, is a well-loved spot for its
    enchanting forest paths, cascading waterfalls, and wooden bridges. The trails
    follow Sprodley Brook, offering both gentle walks and steeper climbs to beautiful
    views. It’s a designated Biological Heritage Site, meaning it’s rich in native
    flora and fauna. The area can be muddy in wet seasons, but it’s a top choice for
    its peaceful, natural setting Leeds-Liverpool Canal Towpath is a longer and more
    level walk, the canal path from Appley Bridge toward Burscough offers scenic views
    and a more open route. This stretch is popular among dog walkers looking for a
    quiet, flat walk with lots of water-side scenery.
