  name: Our favourite places to take dogs in Christchurch
- description: – A stunning location which attracts dog walkers all year round due
    to its panoramic views of the nature reserve, Christchurch Harbour, Bournemouth
    Bay and the Isle of Wight. Dogs will love exploring the diverse habitats, although
    it is of course important that they don’t disturb the wildlife found in the nature
    reserve. There is plenty of parking available, and after a scenic stroll, you
    can enjoy refreshments in the on-site cafe.
  name: Hengitsbury Head
- description: – The beautiful Avon Beach in Christchurch is a popular spot for dog
    walkers. With miles of golden sand and stunning views across the Solent, your
    dog will love running along the shoreline and playing in the waves.
  name: Avon Beach
- description: – Situated in Christchurch, Dorset, boasts a historic charm and picturesque
    views of the English Channel. Amidst lush gardens and woodlands, it’s a serene
    setting for dog walks. Lead rules may apply in some areas, but the castle’s grounds
    offer a scenic backdrop for leisurely strolls with your canine companion.
  name: Highcliffe Castle
- description: – Another great spot in Christchurch, Mudeford Quay offers stunning
    views across Christchurch Harbour and plenty of open spaces for your dog to run
    around in. There’s also a dog-friendly cafe where you can grab a bite to eat.
