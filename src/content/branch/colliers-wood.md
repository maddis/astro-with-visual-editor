  ###### Dog Walking


  ### Dog Walking


  Fun, play, and exercise are the focus of our dog walks.


  Our dog walkers aim to make each walk the highlight of your dog’s day, giving them
  a chance to play, socialise, exercise, and explore new sights and smells, returning
  them home happy and tired.


  Your dog’s safety is always our top priority which is why we never pack walk dogs.
  We want your dog to experience a fun-filled walk whilst under constant supervision,
  without being bombarded by lots of other dogs. Instead, our trained and trusted
  dog walkers will walk your dog with two doggie friends for maximum play and socialisation.


  We also offer socialisation dog walks and a one-to-one dog walking service, if you
  have a dog who needs some alone time with their walker or wants some TLC whilst
  discovering the big wide world.

  ###### Pop-in Pet Sitting


  ### Pop-in Pet Sitting


  Our pet sitting services allow you to get away, happy with the knowledge that your
  pets will be well looked after - comfortable in their own home. Our pet sitter will spend
  time with your pets, make a fuss, feed, provide fresh water as required, and clear
  up any mess. 


  Each of our pet sitters is professionally trained, vetted by us, fully insured and
  background checked. They also have up to date pet first aid training, for extra
  peace of mind. 


  We look after dogs, cats, horses, ponies, small animals, and birds. Don’t worry
  if you have more than one pet – the more the merrier! Before you book, we will schedule
  a meet & greet visit to discuss your animal care routine and ensure we stick to
  your normal pet care practice.

  ###### Dog Sitting


  ### Dog Sitting


  Are you heading out and don’t want to leave your dog alone? Our trusted dog sitting
  service is here to help! Much like babysitting, our professional dog sitters come
  to your home to provide personalised care and companionship for your furry friend.


  You can choose the hours that work best for you, and we’ll ensure your dog feels
  comfortable and cared for in their own home environment. This service is perfect
  for dogs that need one-to-one attention or feel more at ease staying in their familiar
  surroundings.


  Whether it’s for a few hours or an extended period, our experienced team will make
  sure your dog has everything they need while you’re away. From feeding and playtime
  to cuddles and walks, we’re here to keep tails wagging!


  Discover the difference of in-home care with our dog sitting services – reliable,
  flexible, and tailored to you and your pet’s needs.

  ###### Dog Boarding


  ### Dog Boarding


  If you can’t bear the idea of leaving your dog in kennels when you go away on holiday,
  then our home-from-home dog boarding service is perfect for you! Our friendly, local
  home boarders offer all the comforts of home.


  Your dog will be welcomed into a trusted pet sitter’s home as part of their family.
  While you’re away, your dog will be going on a lovely holiday of their own. They
  will become part of the family, enjoying regular walks and plenty of individual
  attention. Dog boarding is perfect for dogs who get on with other dogs and people.


  Our branches are full members of the PCFA, licensed, trained, insured and police
  checked for peace of mind. Our high animal welfare standards mean your dog won’t
  be mass boarded but will instead be cared for as part of the family.

  ###### Doggy Daycare


  ### Doggy Daycare


  Our doggy daycare service is perfect for busy pet parents who want their dogs to
  enjoy a day full of play, companionship, and care. At We Love Pets, we provide a
  safe, stimulating, and welcoming environment where your dog can socialise, explore,
  and relax under our team’s constant supervision.


  Each day is tailored to your dog’s needs, whether they’re zooming around the garden,
  enjoying a scenic walk, or curling up for a cosy nap. With plenty of games, exercise,
  and cuddles, we’ll keep them happy and entertained.


  Your dog’s safety and wellbeing are our top priorities. Our fully trained, pet first
  aid-certified team ensures a calm, relaxed setting with plenty of attention and
  care. Unlike mass boarding, we offer a home-from-home experience, treating your
  dog like part of the family. At the end of their fun-filled day, your dog will come
  home happy, content, and ready for a well-deserved rest, giving you complete peace
  of mind.

  ###### House Sitting


  ### House Sitting


  Going on holiday? Our professional house-sitting service ensures your pets remain
  happy and secure in their familiar surroundings while giving you peace of mind about
  your home’s safety.


  Our experienced sitters are fully insured, police-checked, and trained in pet first
  aid. Before you leave, you’ll meet your sitter to discuss your needs and feel confident
  your home and pets are in expert hands.


  We provide regular updates, including photos and messages, so you’ll stay connected
  with your pets and home while away. From maintaining daily routines to offering
  loving care, our sitters make sure your pets feel at ease.


  Enjoy your trip without worry—our service offers the perfect balance of pet care
  and home security.

  ###### Cat Sitting


  ### Cat Sitting


  Our cat sitting service keeps your feline friend happy, comfortable, and well cared
  for while you’re away. Each visit is tailored to their routine, with plenty of playtime,
  attention, and all-important naps. We’ll clean litter trays, refresh food and water,
  and ensure your cat is content, keeping a close eye on their health and happiness.


  Every cat is unique, so we take time to understand their needs. Whether they love
  fuss or prefer quiet companionship, our trusted sitters provide care to suit their
  personality.


  Our cat sitting service ensures your cat stays relaxed and stress-free with loving
  care from our trained, pet-first-aid-certified team. You’ll also receive updates,
  photos, and peace of mind knowing your cat is in expert hands. Let us take care
  of them so you can enjoy yourself worry-free!

  ###### Puppy Care


  ### Puppy Care


  At We Love Pets, we offer tailored puppy care visits to keep your pup happy, safe,
  and well-looked after while you’re away. Puppies need extra care and attention during
  their early months, and we’re here to help with visits that suit your puppy’s age,
  needs, and your schedule.


  Our friendly team will keep your puppy entertained with plenty of playtime, cuddles,
  and care. Each visit can include essentials like feeding, fresh water, toilet breaks,
  and gentle reinforcement of basic training to help your pup develop good habits.


  As your puppy grows, they’ll have the chance to graduate to group dog walks with
  a few carefully chosen doggie friends. This is a great way to build confidence,
  encourage socialisation, and explore the world in a fun, safe way. You can relax
  knowing your puppy is in the hands of fully trained, pet-first-aid-certified carers
  who love dogs as much as you do!

  What our customers say

  ----------------------


  We have 2 giant rabbits and finding someone who is reliable and understands their
  needs is very difficult. However now we have found Tracey we won’t ever worry again!
  We can’t fault the service. Never had a problem booking her to visit them. Highly
  recommended for pet sitting.


  Helen ForbesCustomer - Reading East


  We can''t praise Kathryn highly enough. She was a pleasure to deal with, went above
  and beyond and made us feel completely reassured. She gave us regular updates while
  we were away and you could tell she genuinely cared for our pets. We wouldn''t hesitate
  to recommend her and her company.


  Katie WaldockCustomer - Burgess Hill


  Absolutely fantastic service. Our BIG dogs had a fabulous walk with Simon and we
  were able to enjoy our day out knowing they were in safe hands, amazing value for
  money. I have already booked again 🙂


  Sarah MorganCustomer - Colchester


  I used we love pets to visit my much loved elderly cat . On each visit I received
  photos and an update. They took patience with her and cleaned up after her . I have
  already recommended them to my family and friends and would do to anyone


  Kath BenCustomer - Bolton


  My (very fussy) dogs love Jon which says a lot! I feel completely at ease leaving
  them in his care, they love spending the day with him, and always come home happy
  after a day of fun 🙂


  Amber PrudhoeCustomer - Newcastle upon Tyne


  Having moved to the area recently - feel very lucky to have found such a great,
  professional and welcoming boarding for our lively black Labrador.

  Paul certainly made him feel part of the family - even included a day trip to the
  lakes and swim in Windermere 👍


  Bertie HilditchCustomer - Lytham


  Andrea and Shan are a godsend, they walk my rescue dog Indi, a nervous girl, every
  week and have been so patient with her. She has come on leaps and bounds and I know
  the interaction with Andrea and Shan has been instrumental in this. I get amazing
  pics and updates. I wouldn''t hesitate to recommend We Love Pets and can''t imagine
  having my dog go with anyone else!


  Sarah RowanCustomer - Sutton


  Pet sitting for small animals. Nothing too much trouble. For anyone any on business
  for a few days, or needing dog visits now back at work. Highly recommend these.


  Sandra IbaukCustomer - Swindon


  Emma and her team have helped me with puppy ever since he was old enough to join
  the gang. Now he has weekly walks and gets to meet and play with other dogs too.
  That one hour walk has him coming home so happy and content!The team are incredibly
  reliable and have helped me with home visits too when I''ve had to be away for long
  periods in the day. Professional and friendly. Thank you!!!
