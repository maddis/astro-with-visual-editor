Emma brings a wealth of experience in animal care and shares her home with her family and her beloved 12-year-old Shih Tzu, Maddie. She holds a City and Guilds qualification in dog walking and is also trained in small animal care and pet first aid.

Having always dreamed of starting her own business, Emma knew it had to revolve around her passion for animals. After being introduced to We Love Pets by Samantha, the owner of our Twyford and Yateley branch, Emma was inspired to join the We Love Pets family. Since then, she has thoroughly enjoyed connecting with customers in the Hartley Wintney area.

As a lifelong resident of Hartley Wintney, Emma is familiar with all the best walking spots for dogs. Some of her top picks include Frimley Lodge Park and Carrington Recreation Ground. Emma is excited to meet her customers and their pets, and explore the beautiful Hartley Wintney area together.
