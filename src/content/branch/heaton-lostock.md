#### **We Love Pets Heaton and Lostock –**

**We Love Pets Heaton and Lostock** is a trusted and reliable team of professional dog walking, pet sitting, and pet care services for Heaton, Lostock, and the surrounding areas. Our team is passionate about working with animals and takes pride in caring for the pets in our community.

With a wide range of pet care services available, we’re confident you’ll find the perfect option for your dog, cat, small animal, or any pet in between! Many of our team members are pet owners themselves, so we understand just how important your furry family members are. That’s why we treat every pet as if they were our own.

Before you decide on a service, we’ll take the time to discuss your pet’s needs and unique personality with you. This allows us to create a personalised pet care plan, ensuring they receive the best possible care.
