Our We Love Pets Herne Bay managers, sisters Holly and Kate, are lifelong locals who grew up with a variety of pets, including dogs, cats, chickens, goats, and numerous hamsters.

Holly enjoys family life with her two young children, where the love for pets is a family tradition—her daughter’s first word was “dog,” and she often giggles at her aunt’s cockapoo, Archie. The family frequently enjoys trips to animal parks and horse riding.

Holly, Kate, and their team love meeting all the pets and their owners in the local community. They are all DBS checked, fully insured, and trained in pet first aid. They are committed to the We Love Pets promise, where pet welfare always comes first.

Call The Team on [**01227 656136**](tel:01227656136) or complete the contact form.
