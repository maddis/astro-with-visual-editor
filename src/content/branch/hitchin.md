  \n### **Meet Charlotte & Tim | We Love Pets Hitchin**\n\n**[07522 568313](tel:07522\
  \ 568313) | [hitchin@welovepets.email](mailto:hitchin@welovepets.email)**\n\nThe\
  \ **We Love Pets Hitchin** branch is led by the wonderful Charlotte and Tim, alongside\
  \ their skilled team of experienced and fully trained pet care professionals. As\
  \ passionate animal lovers, Charlotte and Tim’s commitment to providing welfare-first\
  \ care makes them outstanding branch directors. They prioritise animal welfare at\
  \ every step and continually work to expand their team with like-minded individuals,\
  \ so you can feel confident that your pets are always in the best hands.\n\nIn line\

  8\nPuppy Care\n\n###### Dog Walking\n\n### Dog Walking\n\nFun, play, and exercise\
  \ are the focus of our dog walks.\n\nOur dog walkers aim to make each walk the highlight\
  \ of your dog’s day, giving them a chance to play, socialise, exercise, and explore\
  \ new sights and smells, returning them home happy and tired.\n\nYour dog’s safety\
  \ is always our top priority which is why we never pack walk dogs. We want your\
  \ dog to experience a fun-filled walk whilst under constant supervision, without\
  \ being bombarded by lots of other dogs. Instead, our trained and trusted dog walkers\
  \ will walk your dog with two doggie friends for maximum play and socialisation.\n\
  \nWe also offer socialisation dog walks and a one-to-one dog walking service, if\
  \ you have a dog who needs some alone time with their walker or wants some TLC whilst\
  \ discovering the big wide world.\n\n![Dog Walking](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/A05I9105-min-1024x683.jpg)\n\
  \n###### Pop-in Pet Sitting\n\n### Pop-in Pet Sitting\n\nOur pet sitting services\
  \ allow you to get away, happy with the knowledge that your pets will be well looked\
  \ after - comfortable in their own home. Our pet sitter will spend time with your\
  \ pets, make a fuss, feed, provide fresh water as required, and clear up any mess. \n\
  \nEach of our pet sitters is professionally trained, vetted by us, fully insured\
  \ and background checked. They also have up to date pet first aid training, for\
  \ extra peace of mind. \n\nWe look after dogs, cats, horses, ponies, small animals, and\
  \ birds. Don’t worry if you have more than one pet – the more the merrier! Before\
  \ you book, we will schedule a meet & greet visit to discuss your animal care routine\
  \ and ensure we stick to your normal pet care practice.\n\n![Pop-in Pet Sitting](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gerbil-min-1024x664.jpeg)\n\
  \n###### Dog Sitting\n\n### Dog Sitting\n\nAre you heading out and don’t want to\
  \ leave your dog alone? Our trusted dog sitting service is here to help! Much like\
  \ babysitting, our professional dog sitters come to your home to provide personalised\
  \ care and companionship for your furry friend.\n\nYou can choose the hours that\
  \ work best for you, and we’ll ensure your dog feels comfortable and cared for in\
  \ their own home environment. This service is perfect for dogs that need one-to-one\
  \ attention or feel more at ease staying in their familiar surroundings.\n\nWhether\
  \ it’s for a few hours or an extended period, our experienced team will make sure\
  \ your dog has everything they need while you’re away. From feeding and playtime\
  \ to cuddles and walks, we’re here to keep tails wagging!\n\nDiscover the difference\
  \ of in-home care with our dog sitting services – reliable, flexible, and tailored\
  \ to you and your pet’s needs.\n\n![Dog Sitting](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jenny-garden-1024x683.jpg)\n\
  \n###### Dog Boarding\n\n### Dog Boarding\n\nIf you can’t bear the idea of leaving\
  \ your dog in kennels when you go away on holiday, then our home-from-home dog boarding\
  \ service is perfect for you! Our friendly, local home boarders offer all the comforts\
  \ of home.\n\nYour dog will be welcomed into a trusted pet sitter’s home as part\
  \ of their family. While you’re away, your dog will be going on a lovely holiday\
  \ of their own. They will become part of the family, enjoying regular walks and\
  \ plenty of individual attention. Dog boarding is perfect for dogs who get on with\
  \ other dogs and people.\n\nOur branches are full members of the PCFA, licensed,\
  \ trained, insured and police checked for peace of mind. Our high animal welfare\
  \ standards mean your dog won’t be mass boarded but will instead be cared for as\
  \ part of the family.\n\n![Dog Boarding](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Kathryn-V-sofa-1024x683.jpg)\n\
  \n###### Doggy Daycare\n\n### Doggy Daycare\n\nOur doggy daycare service is perfect\
  \ for busy pet parents who want their dogs to enjoy a day full of play, companionship,\
  \ and care. At We Love Pets, we provide a safe, stimulating, and welcoming environment\
  \ where your dog can socialise, explore, and relax under our team’s constant supervision.\n\
  \nEach day is tailored to your dog’s needs, whether they’re zooming around the garden,\
  \ enjoying a scenic walk, or curling up for a cosy nap. With plenty of games, exercise,\
  \ and cuddles, we’ll keep them happy and entertained.\n\nYour dog’s safety and wellbeing\
  \ are our top priorities. Our fully trained, pet first aid-certified team ensures\
  \ a calm, relaxed setting with plenty of attention and care. Unlike mass boarding,\
  \ we offer a home-from-home experience, treating your dog like part of the family.\
  \ At the end of their fun-filled day, your dog will come home happy, content, and\
  \ ready for a well-deserved rest, giving you complete peace of mind.\n\n![Doggy\
  \ Daycare](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/retired-couple-hosts-1-min-1024x685.jpg)\n\
  \n###### House Sitting\n\n### House Sitting\n\nGoing on holiday? Our professional\
  \ house-sitting service ensures your pets remain happy and secure in their familiar\
  \ surroundings while giving you peace of mind about your home’s safety.\n\nOur experienced\
  \ sitters are fully insured, police-checked, and trained in pet first aid. Before\
  \ you leave, you’ll meet your sitter to discuss your needs and feel confident your\
  \ home and pets are in expert hands.\n\nWe provide regular updates, including photos\
  \ and messages, so you’ll stay connected with your pets and home while away. From\
  \ maintaining daily routines to offering loving care, our sitters make sure your\
  \ pets feel at ease.\n\nEnjoy your trip without worry—our service offers the perfect\
  \ balance of pet care and home security.\n\n![House Sitting](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-laughing--1024x674.jpg)\n\
  \n###### Cat Sitting\n\n### Cat Sitting\n\nOur cat sitting service keeps your feline\
  \ friend happy, comfortable, and well cared for while you’re away. Each visit is\
  \ tailored to their routine, with plenty of playtime, attention, and all-important\
  \ naps. We’ll clean litter trays, refresh food and water, and ensure your cat is\
  \ content, keeping a close eye on their health and happiness.\n\nEvery cat is unique,\
  \ so we take time to understand their needs. Whether they love fuss or prefer quiet\
  \ companionship, our trusted sitters provide care to suit their personality.\n\n\
  Our cat sitting service ensures your cat stays relaxed and stress-free with loving\
  \ care from our trained, pet-first-aid-certified team. You’ll also receive updates,\
  \ photos, and peace of mind knowing your cat is in expert hands. Let us take care\
  \ of them so you can enjoy yourself worry-free!\n\n![Cat Sitting](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WeLovePets_40-1024x724.jpg)\n\
  \n###### Puppy Care\n\n### Puppy Care\n\nAt We Love Pets, we offer tailored puppy\
  \ care visits to keep your pup happy, safe, and well-looked after while you’re away.\
  \ Puppies need extra care and attention during their early months, and we’re here\
  \ to help with visits that suit your puppy’s age, needs, and your schedule.\n\n\
  Our friendly team will keep your puppy entertained with plenty of playtime, cuddles,\
  \ and care. Each visit can include essentials like feeding, fresh water, toilet\
  \ breaks, and gentle reinforcement of basic training to help your pup develop good\
  \ habits.\n\nAs your puppy grows, they’ll have the chance to graduate to group dog\
  \ walks with a few carefully chosen doggie friends. This is a great way to build\
  \ confidence, encourage socialisation, and explore the world in a fun, safe way.\
  \ You can relax knowing your puppy is in the hands of fully trained, pet-first-aid-certified\
  \ carers who love dogs as much as you do!\n\n![Puppy Care](https://welovepets.care/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Puppy-kissing-Alec-CUTE-1024x683.jpg)\n\

  \ had a problem booking her to visit them. Highly recommended for pet sitting.\n\
  \nHelen ForbesCustomer - Reading East\n\nWe can't praise Kathryn highly enough.\
  \ She was a pleasure to deal with, went above and beyond and made us feel completely\

  \ genuinely cared for our pets. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend her and her company.\n\
  \nKatie WaldockCustomer - Burgess Hill\n\nAbsolutely fantastic service. Our BIG\
  \ dogs had a fabulous walk with Simon and we were able to enjoy our day out knowing\

  \ are a godsend, they walk my rescue dog Indi, a nervous girl, every week and have\
