#### **We Love Pets Medway –**

At **We Love Pets Medway**, we are passionate about giving every pet the best possible care. Our friendly and professional team is dedicated to keeping your pets happy, healthy and well cared for. We provide a wide range of pet care services, from **dog walking and pet sitting** to looking after small animals, birds and even horses. No matter what type of pet you have, you can be confident that they are in safe and experienced hands with us.

What makes We Love Pets Medway special is the way we treat every pet as an individual. We know that each pet has its own personality, likes and needs, so we take the time to get to know them and tailor our care to suit. Whether you need a regular dog walker during the week or someone to look after your pets while you are away, we will work with you to provide the perfect service.

With **We Love Pets Medway**, you can have peace of mind knowing your much loved pet will be cared for with the same love and attention we give our own. We are proud to be part of the Medway community, supporting local pet owners and their wonderful animals every day.
