**We Love Pets Orsett** is owned and operated by Shirley, alongside her skilled team of pet care professionals. Every team member is trained in pet first aid, fully insured, and police checked, ensuring that your pets are always in trusted hands.

Shirley is a graduate of the Cambridge Institute of Dog Behaviour and Training, where she excelled in dog handling and training, achieving 100%. She also holds a City and Guilds accredited qualification in dog walking. Shirley is passionate about sharing her knowledge with her team, ensuring the highest level of care for all the animals they look after.

Inspired by her father’s dog walking business, which he launched in 1995, Shirley always dreamed of starting her own. After a thorough search, she joined We Love Pets, turning that dream into reality. Now, as the branch manager for both Grays and Brentwood, Shirley offers dog walking, home boarding, and a wide array of pet care services.
