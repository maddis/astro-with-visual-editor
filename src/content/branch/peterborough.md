### **Meet Mathieu | We Love Pets Peterborough**

**[07359 617434](tel:07359617434) | [peterborough@welovepets.email](mailto:peterborough@welovepets.email)**

**We Love Pets Peterborough** branch owner, Mathieu, is an animal lover who enjoys spending time with his furry friends. He has a wealth of experience caring for a variety of pets including dogs, cats, rabbits, and even rats. He especially loves walking dogs and believes that it’s not only great exercise for the dog but also a wonderful bonding experience between humans and animals.

In the past, Mathieu owned several rats and enjoyed their unique personalities and playful nature. He also has a soft spot for cats, finding their independence and affectionate moments equally endearing.

In his free time, Mathieu can often be found exploring nature trails with his canine companion or snuggling up with his cats on the couch. He believes that pets bring joy and companionship to our lives, and he feels grateful for the opportunity to care for them in his local community.
