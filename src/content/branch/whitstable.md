Our We Love Pets Whitstable managers, sisters Holly and Kate, both grew up in the local area with a wide range of pets from dogs, cats, chickens, goats and many hamsters. Holly enjoys family life and has two young children, where the love for pets runs in the family – her daughters first word was “dog” and you can also catch her giggling at her aunties cockapoo, Archie. They often enjoy family trips to animal parks and horse riding.  

Holly, Kate and their team love meeting all the pets and their owners in the local community. They are all police DBS checked, fully insured and pet first aid trained. They strongly believe in the We Love Pets promise, where pet welfare always comes first.
